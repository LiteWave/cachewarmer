# cachewarmer
2013 Perf App for warming up our servers, cache, etc.

To use this project:
- Close repo.
- Open in VS 2013.
- Build the project for the first time.
- Make sure that PostUL test is set to 0% testing.
- Run the test. This will perform a step test up to 200 users and load our levels into memory.
NOTE: we cache levels for 60 seconds so run this right before a Show is announced.
